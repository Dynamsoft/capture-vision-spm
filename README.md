# Dynamsoft Capture Vision

Dynamsoft Capture Vision (DCV) is an aggregating SDK of a series of specific functional products, which cover image capturing, content understanding, result parsing, and interactive workflow.

1. With the implementation of the Image Source Adapter (ISA) interface, a seamless integration with DCV is possible, allowing easy access to various image sources.
2. Dynamsoft Barcode Reader (DBR), Dynamsoft Document Normalizer (DDN), and Dynamsoft Label Recognizer (DLR) play crucial roles in reading barcodes, structures, and texts from images.
3. Dynamsoft Code Parser (DCP) is utilized to extract meaningful fields from text/bytes results, ensuring optimal data parsing capabilities.
4. To seamlessly access intermediate and final results within the DCV SDK, the Capture Result Receiver (CRR) and Intermediate Result Receiver (IRR) interfaces are provided. After users implement these interfaces and register with DCV, they can obtain the results efficiently and conveniently.
5. To view and edit the output results, Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer (DCE) provide a suite of robust viewing and editing functions.

DCV powers your software development through the following aspects:

1. Simplicity with Packable Scenarios
2. Scalability with Pluggable Components
3. Flexibility With Customizable Workflows
4. High Performance With Shared Computations
5. Bidirectional Interactivity with Intermediate Results

DCV enables you to develop highly customizable applications for barcode reading, label recognition, document board detection, and result parsing. These applications offer enterprise-grade performance and can be tailored to meet your specific business needs.
